\b\fs36 About

\

\fs30 Description
\fs24 \
  The Whiteboard Famework for Wordpress is built to speed up the process of developing a Wordpress theme. Whiteboard does so by eliminating the time spent on Wordpress' backend PHP that is common to all Wordpress powered Web site. Now paired with Less Framework, Whiteboard even further reduces the development time to create a Wordpress powered responsive website.\
\
\

\fs28 Responsive Web Design and Less Framework:
\fs24 \
  The idea behind Less Framework is to present visitors with a website tailored to the device they are using. If visitors load a website using their desktop computer the experience will be custom tailored for that sized screen. Similarly, if they load it on their iPhone or Smartphone they will view the same website but with a different layout, custom tailored for their device. A nice example of this practice is Stephen Caver's website (http://stephencaver.com/)\
  Further reading can be found on A List Apart (http://www.alistapart.com/articles/responsive-web-design/) or on Less Framework (http://lessframework.com)\
\
\

\fs30 Copyright
\fs24 \
  The Whiteboard Framework is licensed under the GPL license. Feel free to use the Whiteboard Framework for commercial and non-commercial ventures. We only require a link in the CSS and greatly appreciate a link somewhere on the Web site.\
  Less Framework is licensed under the MIT license. A credit link is required in either the CSS file and/or on the website somewhere.\
\
\

\fs30 Compatibility
\fs24 \
  Current known compatibility is with Wordpress 3.2.1\
  Compatibility with earlier versions or Wordpress is currently unknown, but should be functional - at least with Wordpress 3.0 and up. But who needs compatibility with older versions always? Upgrade people!\
\
\

\fs30 Building Websites with the Whiteboard Framework
\fs24 \
  At the minimum building with the Whiteboard Famework requires knowledge in HTML5 & CSS, at least a basic knowledge of PHP is recommended. Reference the Wordpress.org Codex for explanations on specific PHP tags and expanding and customizing Whiteboard further.\
\
\

\fs28 Removing Less Framework 3, All Basic Styling, & CSS Reset:
\fs24 \
  Remove the line of CSS in header.php that calls "lessframework.css" and "theme.css" located right above the call for "style.css" very close to the end of the </head> tag (Yes, that's all you have to do)\
\
\

\fs28 Making Images Resize Proportionally for Varying Sizes:
\fs24 \
  Making your images resize as the website changes widths is very easy to do. Check out Responsive Images on Github (https://github.com/filamentgroup/Responsive-Images)\
  A great example of this practice is Hicks Design's Website (http://www.hicksdesign.co.uk/)\

\fs30 Bugs
\fs24 \
  Slight inconsistencies between the list of divs in style.css and the actual divs used in Whiteboard (not even really a bug)\
